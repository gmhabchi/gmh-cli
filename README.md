# GMH-CLI
This is a bunch of functions I've put together that help me all written in bash but there is some expectations on what you have installed;

- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)
- [aws-cli](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
- [pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/install/)
- [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.js.org/en/installation)

Not important but nice to have;
- [figlet](http://www.figlet.org/)
